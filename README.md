Repository for `pdfgen`, an application written in Kotlin used to create PDFs and HTMLs

## Technologies & Tools

* Kotlin
* Gradle
* Ktor
* Junit
* Handlebars
* VeraPDF-validation
* JDK 21
* Docker
* pdfgen-core

## Getting started

Most commonly, pdfgen is used as a base image alongside templates, fonts, additional resources, and potential test data to verify that valid PDFs get produced by the aforementioned templates.

In your own repository, create a Dockerfile with the following contents

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/navikt/pdfgen:<release>

COPY templates /app/templates # handlebars templates
COPY fonts /app/fonts         # fonts to be embedded
COPY resources /app/resources # additional resources
```

Check GitHub releases to find the latest `release` version 
Check [GitHub releases](https://github.com/navikt/pdfgen/releases) to find the latest `release` version

Set up the basic folder structure
```bash
mkdir {templates,fonts,resources,data}
```

Create subfolders in `templates` and `data`
```bash
mkdir {templates,data}/your_teamname # your_teamname can be anything, but it'll be a necessary part of the API later
```

* `templates/your_teamname/` should then be populated with your .hbs-templates. the names of these templates will also decide parts of the API paths
* `data/your_teamname/` should be populated with json files with names corresponding to a target .hbs-template, this can be used to test your PDFs during development of templates.

### Helpers
[https://github.com/navikt/pdfgen-core/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/no/nav/pdfgen/core/template/Helpers.kt](https://github.com/navikt/pdfgen-core/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/no/nav/pdfgen/core/template/Helpers.kt) contains a collection of customs Helpers which implements functionality that is not part of the Handlebars language itself.

## Developing pdfgen

### Build and run tests
```shell script
./gradlew shadowJar
```
or on windows
```shell script
gradlew.bat shadowJar
```


Running the application locally enables a GET endpoint at `/api/v1/genpdf/<application>/<template>`
which looks for test data at `data/<application>/<template>.json` and outputs a PDF to your browser.
Additionally, the template folder will be fetched on every request, and reflect any changes made since the last GET,
making this ideal for developing new templates for your application.

The template and data directory structure both follow the `<application>/<template>` structure.

To enable HTML document support, use the environment variable `ENABLE_HTML_ENDPOINT=true`. This will enable the 
HTML endpoints on `/api/v1/genhtml/<application>/<template>`. 

By default, pdfgen will load all assets (`templates`, `resources`, `data`) to memory on startup. Any change on files inside these folders will not be loaded before a restart of the application. However if you are developing templates you can make the application to reload the assets on every request by setting `DEV_MODE=true`.

### Getting github package registry packages
Some packages used in this repo is uploaded to the GitHub Package Registry which requires authentication. 
It can, for example, be solved like this in Gradle:
```
val githubUser: String by project
val githubPassword: String by project
repositories {
    maven {
        credentials {
            username = githubUser
            password = githubPassword
        }
        setUrl("https://maven.pkg.github.com/openhtmltopdf/openhtmltopdf)
    }
}
```

`githubUser` and `githubPassword` can be put into a separate file `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` with the following content:

```                                                     
githubUser=x-access-token
githubPassword=[token]
```

Replace `[token]` with a personal access token with scope `read:packages`.

Alternatively, the variables can be configured via environment variables:

* `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_githubUser`
* `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_githubPassword`

Example in a .bashrc file:
```
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_githubUser='username'
export ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_githubPassword='personal access token'
```

or the command line:

```
./gradlew -PgithubUser=x-access-token -PgithubPassword=[token]
```

### Release
We use default GitHub release, 
This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and does NOT prefix tags or release titles with `v` i.e. use `1.2.3` instead of `v1.2.3` 

see guide about how to relese:[creating release github](
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)


### Upgrading the gradle wrapper
Find the newest version of gradle here: https://gradle.org/releases/ Then run this command:

```shell script
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version $gradleVersjon
```


## pdfgen 2.0

`pdfgen` 2.0 targets a new PDF standard, [PDF/A-2a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A#PDF/A-2), as well as [PDF/UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/UA).
The primary goal is to produce PDFs that are not only valid for archival, but also valid according to Universal Accessibility standards.
This introduces a few "breaking" changes, although they are not enforced by pdfgen; it is still possible to produce PDFs that don't achieve "Universal Accessibility" as defined by PDF/UA.

At the time of writing, none of the documentation exists to describe how to produce PDFs with proper UA for template writers.
As such, here be dragons!

A [licensed Adobe Acrobat DC](https://gist.github.com/karinaldw/1c4c321fe05bdc1e8996e00722d5317a#adobe-acrobat-dc-pdf) can help you check whether the PDFs you generate achieve UA. 
[PAC 3](https://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-accessibility-checker.html) (Windows only) is another tool for UA verification.
